Who am I to stand in your way? Go ahead; swallow me down! I\\'ll have no problems finding myself out When you\\'ve gone down When your all cracked and wound.\" Getting used to pain  I am crying unwept tears through this violence I\\'ll die trying to break this thick crust of silence  Trading pain is a bad deal I\\'ve got more than my share Too much to bear! Every beat of the hammer Every blood stricken street: A way to trade off heat.  They will bleed till I\\'m empty If I deserve to die I\\'ll make it show I will stain your affection, I will wear out your heart You\\'ll follow where I go  Blood stains Cut veins Filthy Murder Leave me...
